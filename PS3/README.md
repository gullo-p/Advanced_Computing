As you probably remember, I was not able to run the cluster on AWS, and also locally my ipython notebook was not working with pySpark.

So, what I did is to fill in the gaps in the notebook file and check locally through pySpark from the terminal that the code was running.
That is why you won't be able to see the correct outputs on my notebook file.

Of course, there are some commands which I could not check because they were related to the aws cluster, but they should be just the first two in the first "box".

I hope this is ok for you and does not create issues.
